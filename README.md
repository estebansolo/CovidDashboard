# Covid 19 Dashboard

This is a basic dashboard created using the [Plotly | Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) library of Python, while learning how to use it.
<br />
I also used Pandas to work with the [Covid 19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)

## What I Learned

  - Callbacks
  - Interactive Graphing
  - Use of Dash Core Components
  - Live Updates

## With Docker

  - `docker-compose up -d` to create the container

## Without Docker

  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
  - `python3 app.py` to run the application

Then, Go to `http://localhost:8050`
